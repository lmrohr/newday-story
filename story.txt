On one sunny Thursday afternoon, Buckingham Badger was sitting in Wendt Library finishing his computer science program, anxioulsy waiting to get home for the night. 
Suddenly, he heard a noise outside the window and looking out, realized that while he was busy debugging his program, the sun had set and he was all alone in the most haunted library on campus.
He called out to see if anyone could hear him but not a soul was listening. He immediately decided to run, sprinting as fast as he could to get to the door. When he got there, however, the door was locked. Trying to stay as calm as he could, he grabbed his backpack and slowly walked through the dark streets of Madison home, to where he would finish his program in the safe, quiet environment of his home.
