On one sunny Thursday afternoon, Buckingham Badger was sitting in Wendt Library finishing his computer science program, anxioulsy waiting to get home for the night. 
Suddenly, he heard a noise outside the window and looking out, realized that while he was busy debugging his program, the sun had set and he was all alone in the most haunted library on campus.
He called out to see if anyone could hear him but not a soul was listening. He immediately decided to run, sprinting as fast as he could to get to the door. When he got there, however, the door was locked. Trying to stay as calm as he could, he grabbed his backpack and slowly walked through the dark streets of Madison home, to where he would finish his program in the safe, quiet environment of his home. 
As he turned down his street, he had an eery feeling that someone had been following since he had busted out of the library. He had known Wendt library was haunted, he had heard the stories for years from alumni in his family. 
He entered his home and sunk into his couch to finish his program, after he had turned all of the lights in the house on, trying to forget about the creepy feeling looming over him. 
He opened up his laptop to work on the rest of his program and to his delight, his previously broken program was magically compiling! Everything was functioning and was passng all of his tests. A miracle! At the top of his main class, he found the comment, "No one deserves to sepnd a Thursday night writing a program instead of being with their friends. Have fun tonight, kiddo. - Goldy". The ghost of the golden gophers had finished his program! What a lucky guy. .
